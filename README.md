## About me

My name is Aurelia Czulińska. I spent the last couple of years studying Philosophy at the University of Warsaw and trying out different lines of work. My most recent experience was three years as Junior Internal Communication Specialist in a major retail company in Poland. I also have experience in graphic design, video editing and video game manual testing. Recently I decided to further develop my technical skills and knowledge about software testing. This site presents the results of my participation in a dedicated QA challenge and my personal research.
